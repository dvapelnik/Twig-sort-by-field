# Twig SortByField Extension
A Twig Extension filter to sort an array of entries (objects or arrays) by an entry field.

# Install
With composer

    composer require snilius/twig-sort-by-field

# Sample
The list could look like this, but obviously with more than one key per array
.
```php
$base = array(
  array(
    "name" => "Redmine"
  ),
  array(
    "name" => "GitLab"
  ),
  array(
    "name" => "Jenkins"
  ),
  array(
    "name" => "Piwik"
  )
);
```

```twig
{% for item in base | sortbyfield('name') %}

    {{ item.name }}

{% endfor %}
```
